What is Multimodal AI?
Think about how you understand the world. If you see a picture of a dog in a park and someone asks, “What is the dog doing?” you don’t just analyze the text of the question or the pixels of the image. You instantly fuse both. You see the dog (vision) and understand the query (language) to form an answer: “It’s catching a frisbee.”
That, in a nutshell, is multimodal AI. It’s a system that can process, understand, and reason about information from multiple modalities (such as text, images, and audio) simultaneously.
The specific task we’ll build today is called Visual Question Answering (VQA). It’s a classic multimodal task:
Input: An image + a text-based question about the image.
Output: A text-based answer.
By building this simple Visual Question Answering app, you’ve done more than just link two libraries. You’ve created a system that perceives the world in a more human-like way. This is the foundation for everything from apps that describe the world to the visually impaired to creative co-pilots that can brainstorm ideas based on a sketch and a conversation.
